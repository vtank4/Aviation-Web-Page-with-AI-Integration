## Introduction

This project was bootstrapped with [`NextJS`](https://nextjs.org), [`TailwindCSS`](https://tailwindcss.com), [`ShadCN UI`](https://ui.shadcn.com), [`AceternityUI`](https://ui.aceternity.com), [`MagicUI`](https://magicui.design) and [`next-safe-action`](https://next-safe-action.dev)

## Get Started

### Setting up `NextJS`

- **Prerequisite**: Make sure that you have successfully bootstrapped your server and your server is running at `http://localhost:8000`
- Change to `client-next` directory.
- Use the command below to install all of the required packages

  ```sh
  npm install # (Or yarn install, pnpm install or bun install depends on your package manager)
  ```

- Start-up your application using the following command:

  ```sh
  npm run dev # (Or yarn dev, pnpm run dev or bun run dev depends on your package manager)
  ```

- Voila, now your server is running and will be served (by default) at: http://localhost:8000.
